## Info
This version of the website was developed as part of the LSU Geaux Hack 2022 event run by LSU SASE and sponsored by Vigilus. 

The prompt we chose was as follows:

> Pursuing a degree is one issue, but determining which courses to take in order to fulfill a degree is an issue that makes the education aspect of college more difficult. Students are overwhelmed with too much information on what classes to take and what classes could be used to fulfill certain requirements. Create a platform which helps students have an easier time determining their degree path.
